    /// This test data was manually curated from alleles found in hla_nom_p (v3330)
    /// It is used when we need to guarantee that a p-group level match grade is possible
    ///
    /// To ensure a p-group level match, and not a g-group level, we must ensure we choose alleles in the same p-group but not the same g-group
    /// For some loci, only one allele exists with this relationship, hence we must explicitly set patient and donor alleles separately
    ///
    /// Patient HLA is chosen as the alleles that exist in a p-group, of which the rest of the alleles all share a g-group
    /// Donor HLA is the remainder of the p-group, with some caveats.
    /// (1) Alleles with the same first two fields as the patient allele have been removed, so as to avoid a better match
    /// (2) Alleles failing a HLA Metadata lookup have been commented out.
    ///    - Presumably this is due discrepancies between the version of the HLA Nomenclature used for selecting example alleles at the time of
    ///      writing, and the v3.3.3.0 of the WMDA's HLA Nomenclature used in these tests.
