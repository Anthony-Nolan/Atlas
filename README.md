# Atlas - Donor Search Algorithm As a Service

>_Atlas is licensed under the GNU GPL-v3.0 (or later) license. For details see the [license file](LICENSE)._

There are several HLA matching algorithms in use worldwide, but Atlas is unique in being the only one that is free to use and open source. It uses cutting-edge cloud technology to implement the latest agreed-upon clinical guidelines for unrelated, hematopoietic stem cell donor matching and selection. It is based on [Anthony Nolan](https://www.anthonynolan.org/)â€™s own donor search algorithm and has been further enhanced for use in [WMDA's Search & Match Service](https://wmda.info/professionals/optimising-search-match-connect/programme-services/) for the benefit of the global, stem cell transplant community.
