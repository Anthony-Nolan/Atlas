# Matching Algorithm

- matchingTestData.sql

This script will insert some arbitrary (pre-processed) donor data to the transient database. 
This data was generated by the validation test framework, using Matching Dictionary version 3330.
Running it on the transient database locally should give a small, searchable dataset without the need to run the full data refresh.
