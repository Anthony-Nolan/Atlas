We should confirm that this was the case, and if so, either manually trigger a continuation of the stalled job (via the `ContinueDataRefresh` 
function) ,or run appropriate clean-up. See the README of the Atlas.MatchingAlgorithm project for more information.
The function `RunDataRefreshCleanup` should encapsulate the majority of the necessary clean-up.
CAVEAT: Due to restrictions of triggers in Azure functions, this function will run once a year not at start-up.
Check the crontab of the `CheckIfCleanupNecessary` function to ensure it isn't this known false positive.'";
